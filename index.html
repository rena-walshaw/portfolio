            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Serena Walshaw, and I am a passionate software developer with a focus on creating intuitive and efficient applications. My journey in the tech world began with a career as a Health Information Technology (HIT) Implementation Specialist, which laid the foundation for my skills in technology and project management.</p>

            <p>After discovering my love for coding and problem-solving, I pursued a degree in Software Engineering from Western Governors University. Throughout my studies, I learned various programming languages and frameworks, including C#, Swift, SwiftUI, and Python. I have completed courses in Data Management, Cloud Foundations, UI Design, and more, which have equipped me with a solid technical foundation and a keen eye for user experience.</p>

            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am proud of my career in the Army as an Air Traffic Controller, where I honed in on my abilities to stay focused, communicate clearly, and stay calm under pressure. These experiences have shaped me into a dedicated and resilient professional, always ready to tackle new challenges.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am working on an introspective app that maps your life path through numbers, patterns, and birth details. My goal is to create user-friendly and visually appealing applications that simplify complex tasks for users.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, photography, and watching T.V. I am always eager to learn and grow, both personally and professionally.</p>

            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting and sharing my work with you!</p>
