            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Serena Walshaw, a passionate software developer with a focus on building user-friendly, purposeful applications. My journey started as a Health Information Technology (HIT) Implementation Specialist and continued through a rewarding career in the army—where I developed strong leadership and problem-solving skills.</p>

            <p>I’m currently earning my B.S. in Software Engineering from Western Governors University and have completed hands-on projects in Swift, C#, SQL, Angular, and more. From building mobile apps to developing interactive web platforms, I love bringing ideas to life through code.</p>

            <p>One of my current goals is to create digital tools that solve real-world problems—starting with military and health-focused applications. Outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, reading, and exploring new ideas.</p>
