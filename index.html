        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Serena Walshaw, and I am a passionate software developer with a focus on creating intuitive and efficient applications. My journey in the tech world began with a career as a Health Information Technology (HIT) Implementation Specialist, which laid the foundation for my skills in technology and project management.

          After discovering my love for coding and problem-solving, I pursued a degree in Software Engineering from Western Governors University. Throughout my studies, I gained proficiency in various programming languages and frameworks, including Swift, SwiftUI, and Python. I have completed courses in Data Management, Cloud Foundations, UI Design, and more, which have equipped me with a solid technical foundation and a keen eye for user experience.

          In addition to my technical skills, I am proud of my career in the army, where I developed strong leadership and teamwork abilities. These experiences have shaped me into a dedicated and resilient professional, always ready to tackle new challenges.

          Currently, I am working on an app that provides PDF documents of army forms, starting with army counselings. My goal is to create user-friendly and visually appealing applications that simplify complex tasks for users.

          Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, reading, and exploring new technologies. I am always eager to learn and grow, both personally and professionally.

          Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting and sharing my work with you!</p>
